## Running Your Own Client
This is a client for the (Pacman Final Project)[https://github.com/snow-fall-2024/finalproject-mateo-taft-thomas.git]. 

To run it, download a copy of this repository and run it.  The client will ask you for an API Key and a Base URL.  The base URL will be the address of the server that the console is running on.   
For example:
```bash
https://projectpacmanapi.azurewebsites.net
```

The API key can be found in the Profile settings after logging into the game.  The API key should look like:
```bash
VTBNOIQGWBN9VRF9DEFA96S1XSNOD2TY
```
