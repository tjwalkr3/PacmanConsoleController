## Running Your Own Client
This is a client for the (Pacman Final Project)[https://github.com/snow-fall-2024/finalproject-mateo-taft-thomas.git]. 

To run it, download a copy of this repository and run the command `dotnet run`.  The client will ask you for an API Key and a Base URL.  The base URL will be the address of the server that the console is running on.   
For example:
```bash
https://projectpacmanapi.azurewebsites.net
```

The API key can be found in the Profile settings after logging into the game.  The API key should look like:
```bash
VTBNOIQGWBN9VRF9DEFA96S1XSNOD2TY
```

Then it will ask you to join one of the listed games.  After you specify what game you would like to join, you will be able to control your player.  You can use either the arrow keys or WASD.
